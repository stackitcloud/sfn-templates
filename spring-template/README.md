# STACKIT Functions - SpringBoot Function Template

This template provides a basic structure for developing serverless functions using SpringBoot for STACKIT Functions. 

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/functions/CloudFunctionApplication.java`: This is the main entry point for your function.
- `stackit-functions.yaml`: Manifest file for STACKIT Functions. Contains environment settings and other configured data.

## Server Wrapper and Exposed Routes

This template is designed to work with a server wrapper that facilitates HTTP request handling.

By default the template exports the following route:
- `GET /`: The default HTTP handler for your function. In this template, it responds with `Hello from STACKIT Functions`.

Other requests will return a 404 response.

## Local Development

We highly recommend using the STACKIT Functions CLI in development.

To build this function:

````bash
sfn function build --image IMAGE_NAME
````

Run the function locally:

```bash
sfn function run
```

This command will start a local server, making your function accessible for testing at `http://localhost:8080` (or another port if configured).


## Function Deployment

Deploy your function to STACKIT Functions by using the following command:

````bash
sfn function deploy
````
